====================

This project contains an analysis of SAT scores using a dataset from New York City schools.
The objective of this study is to understand patterns in SAT performance and build a predictive model for SAT Math scores.

Files Included:
---------------
1. **SAT_Analysis_Report.md** - The main report in Markdown format.
2. **Dataset Files** - CSV and Excel files containing SAT score data.

Key Steps in the Analysis:
--------------------------
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, data cleaning)
- Exploratory data analysis (distribution of scores, key statistics)
- Model training (linear regression for SAT Math score prediction)
- Conclusion and insights

Model Performance:
------------------
- Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 61.28
- RÂ² Score: 0.234

Future Improvements:
---------------------
- Adding more features (e.g., socioeconomic data, school funding)
- Exploring advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

How to Use:
-----------
1. Open the `SAT_Analysis_Report.md` file to read the full analysis.
2. Use Python and Jupyter Notebook to replicate the analysis.
3. Modify and extend the analysis for further insights.
